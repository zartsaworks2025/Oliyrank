## ⭐ Vision

Education in Uzbekistan is fragmented and confusing.  
OliyRank fixes that.

The platform will offer:

- University rankings with clear criteria  
- Student reviews with upvote/downvote  
- Tuition, scholarship info, and cost of living  
- Faculty details  
- Employment rates  
- Compare-universities tool  
- Bookmarking + user profiles  
- Full multilingual support (UZ, EN, RU)  
- Modern UI with dark/light mode  

This is the first serious attempt to bring **QS-style ranking** to Uzbekistan, but cleaner and more transparent.
